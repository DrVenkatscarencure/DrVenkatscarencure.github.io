<br>The physio team took care on each and every aspect in reducing my pain and stiffness.
<br>I was much worried about why I am having such frequent attacks of pain though I maintain a normal and a healthy lifestyle, the team resolved my problem by diagnosing it to be back strain due to my work stress.
<br>I really cudnt realise that such things would real hurt and knowing such small small ergonomics would help me relive pain and lead a more healthy life . 
<br>1st 3 to 5 days they just gave me pain reliving modalities, next they guided me in dos and donts.
<br>Slowly started with small, simple free exercises which I am doing it now daily as taking it as daily routine.
<br>I am very happy now with no pain and mainly very happy because I came to know about wht exactly is causing me the problem.</p>

My physiotherapist Dr Venkat was very helpful, friendly and knowledgeable in regards to helping me with my neck pain. I saw immediate improvement after first visit, by the second and last visit with him I was completely healed. Prior to seeing I couldn't keep my head straight, or sleep comfortably due to very sharp pains. I am so glad I took it upon myself to receive help from him was totally worth it. Would highly recommend&nbsp;</p>

              <p class="mbr-fonts-style  display-7">I had been to this clinic with frozen shoulder problem. Dr.Venkat suggested treatment and exercises which the staff at the centre helped me with. They took real good care of me during the treatment. 
<br>
<br>This is not the first time that I went to their clinic. I had been there a few years ago too, for getting my back pain treated. Then also, the doctor had suggested exercises as part of my treatment. His staff was really understanding and helpful in getting rid of the back pain. 
<br>
<br>The doctor always listened to my concerns and advised changes in exercises according to the improvement in my condition. The next time when I went to the clinic with frozen shoulder, I observed that the doctor and his staff treated me the same way as before, listened to my concerns and helped me a great deal in improving my condition. 
<br>
<br>The doctor and his staff are approachable anytime. I really appreciate the kind of care they give to patients. They put in a lot of effort in making me feel comfortable during the treatment. The importance they show in caring and curing the patient is really commendable. 
<br>
<br>Thanks a ton to Dr.Venkat and his team of physiotherapists.
<br>Thank you for putting up with my weird treatment schedules at the clinic. That was a great help indeed.
<br>
<br>I strongly recommend this clinic to anyone who wants to get relief from pain due to orthopedic and neuro problems.</p>
